## Summarizing The Results of Calculating Par Yields

This chapter detailed the calculation of par yields from the term structure of interest rates estimated in Chapter Four.  Par yields provide issuers and investors information about the potential cost and returns of bonds. Borrowers and lenders use par yields to evaluate fixed or floating rate debt.  Future chapters consider yield to maturity- a different but related concept.
